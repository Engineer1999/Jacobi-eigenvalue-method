# Jacobi-eigenvalue-method
Here is matlab Program to find Singular Value Decomposition. I have also added mean square error calculation in the code to compare it with matlab's inbuilt function ([U,S,V] = svd(A)). This programe is good for small matrix (n=40). After that it will take time to calculate.
