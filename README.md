# Singular Value Decomposition using Jacobi Eigenvalue method

## Discription
Singular Value Decomposition has been implimented in this repository in matlab. Given algorithmes can take input as image file and as simple matrix format. Comparison with the inbuilt matlab function [U,S,V] = svd(A) is performed on the basis of lease square error is calculation. 

## What is Singular Value Decomposition?
In linear algebra, the singular value decomposition (SVD) is a factorization of a real or complex matrix that generalizes the eigendecomposition of a square normal matrix to any M x N matrix.

## What is Jacobi Eigenvalue method?
In numerical linear algebra, the Jacobi eigenvalue algorithm is an iterative method for the calculation of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a real symmetric matrix (a process known as diagonalization).



# Installation
Fork the repository and open the MAIN.m file in matlab. The given code will work on images as well as simple matrices. Follow the guidline given in the code for your required output.
